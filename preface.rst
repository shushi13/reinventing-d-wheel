Reinventing D wheel
===================

Part I

Preface
-------

This is a book about reinventing the wheel. It is an experiment, that you might want to be involved or just read and enjoy.

First of all, this is going to be a book splitted in two parts. This is the first part of the book and it covers the past whereas the second one will cover the present. I am going to write both parts in parallel but you will be able to read just the first part. This preface is necessarily to be written in the present, even that this is the field for part II.

In this book, we have some rules for you, as a reader or participant, before you read ahead. If you agree with all of them, then you are welcome.

  1. You should try (really hard especially if you know me in person) to keep me blind and uninformed for everything related to this book or its subject. When all this becomes more famous, I should not know about it. I should not be thanked, encouraged, criticized, contacted, helped or whatever. The consequence is that you might get mentioned in the second part of this book how you screwed this experiment. :)

  2. Since this is an experiment, it could never end or be finished in any reasonable way. So that I could write 40 pages of this book and die in a crash or I could just lose interest. This is more a warning than a rule.

  3. You can clone this book (repository), edit, change names, translate, criticize on your blog, book, newspaper, tv, radio show, etc. You can even be the author of this book. Yes, you can write your name under this book and call yourself the author. Only if you include this keyword "reinventingdwheel", or play the following sound "reinventingdwheel" (TODO: create a simple sound file), or show constantly the following sign/letter "D" with yellow color on gray circle background at the bottom right corner. It would be ideal if in any moment I can understand that there is a spoiler for me and close my senses. This rule is specifically for me, because I am a software developer and will create some tools to help me stay blind for that information (TODO: create the tools so other can use them too). Using the above signs I will help you better keep the secret from me and keep the promised rule number 1. I will look for these signs before I read, listen or watch something. These signs are necessary only until I release the second part of the book.

  4. Do not bother my family or the people that are close to me.

If you are close to me and maybe know me personally, please consider to not read this book or at least try to act like I do. Stay uninformed and blind intentionally. Close your senses on every sign from above. You can use the tools that I will publish as soon as I create them.

I am not a book writer and do not know English so good, but I chose to write in English because it is better suited for this experiment. Considering this, you are mostly encouraged to clone this repository as rule number 3 suggests. My native language is Bulgarian, so a translation in Bulgarian is especially needed. As a whole, this book/repository should not be read directly from here, but from a clone. The book is free and you can even charge or sell, while keeping the rules from above. Consider the rules as the license.

My goal is to write every week, at least a page, in both parts. So I think you will be able to read this book every week. The first part will stop (be finished) when I get to today and will continue in the second part. My expectation is that the two parts will not be quite in sync to finish both of them at the same time. However I will try to do just that. So you will be able to read the second part as a whole book at once. The time frame is not set in stone and will be around half an year.

The second part of the book will cover the present and will continue from the first part. However, the second will contain my thoughts and actions in much different way than the first. Since this book is one thing and the first part is in the past, while the second is for the present (read my future) where I can change everything while writing.

Do not click on the following link until you read this paragraph. If you are famous (like 100 000 people know you), you should search your name in this spoiler (TODO: make it a link) list of names. These people are part of this book story and if you do not want to get spoiled (definition: like knowing something before you read the whole story) do Not read/click it. If you are part of this spoiler list, please, be extra careful and probably follow the advice like you are a person who knows me in person even that you actually do not know me at all, I know you very well. :)

This whole book might look to you too strange, without answering a lot of questions, but you will understand why I am writing it, when you start reading the second part. Even though you probably will be able to deduce the answers from the first part.

Even that you accept the rules, there will be always someone who will not know or care enough to keep them. Do not judge them, we are all humans.
Also, I will change the real names of the people in the book. This is because I can't ask them, whether I can use their real names.
Now you may start to read the first page of the first chapter. Of course, at the moment I am still writing it.
